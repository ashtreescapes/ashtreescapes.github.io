This is our first update on the Smarties website about what we’re working on
and what we’ve achieved so far! This update focuses on the social science part
of the project; the bit that’s about people and society.

Before we can begin our research into attitudes and behaviours towards ash
trees and associated pests and diseases, we needed to take a deep dive into
the evidence and literature about ash trees that’s already out there. As part
of this we’ve looked into topics such as what social, cultural, historic and
personal values are associated with ash trees.

What we’ve found is evidence from around the world of ash trees being mentioned
in Norse mythology, British folklore, historic agricultural systems, place
names, art, and traditional crafts in First Nation communities. For example,
Wordsworth and Yeats mentioned ash trees in some of their works; there’s a
painting of an ash tree by John Constable in the Victoria and Albert Museum
in London; Neolithic trackways in Somerset were constructed using ash; and ash
wood has historically been used to make hockey sticks, shinty sticks and hurling
sticks. Not only that but there are 955 other species of fauna and flora associated
with ash trees.

So why does this matter? It matters because it helps us understand why we don’t want
to lose ash trees to pests and diseases. If we lose ash trees we potentially lose
all of these other things that connect us to our past, and to places and activities
that we value.

Crucially, understanding why things are important to us, in what ways, helps us to
understand what we might be prepared to do (or not do) to protect them. With ash
trees in some parts of Great Britain already being massively impacted by ash
dieback, and with growing concerns about when, not if, Emerald Ash Borer might be
found in this country, the need for surveillance and management of ash trees has
never been greater. This requires anyone with any responsibility for ash trees to
be aware of the challenges, aware of the options for management and treatment, and
willing and able to act when required. Our actions are motivated by a myriad of
influences and influencers but most deep seated of all those influences are our
underlying values. By shining a light on those (and much else) in this project we
hope to find the best ways to keep protecting ash trees as they potentially face
the twin threats of ash dieback and Emerald Ash Borer.
