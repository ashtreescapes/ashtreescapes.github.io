Three online workshops gathered a range of stakeholders who manage ash trees in some capacity from public to private and
covering large to small areas of land. Participants were drawn from those that had already responded to Forest
Research’s survey of land managers.

The workshops used a serious gaming approach, having participants roleplay through a scenario of emerald ash borer (EAB)
arriving in the UK. Participants made choices on how to react at key decision points before and after the beetle’s
arrival, followed by a short reflective discussion of those choices. Each workshop followed a new scenario, testing how
participants’ choices might change over time or with additional information (Table x).

Participants currently do some level of standard health and safety checks, checking for a variety of pests and diseases
that are already a threat to trees in the UK, such as Ash dieback (ADB) and Oak Processionary Moth (OPM). After learning
that by the time canopy damage is visible from the ground, the population of beetles would probably have been
established for a few years and therefore have spread further than it would be possible to contain and eradicate,
participants added sticky traps, trap trees and under-bark inspections to their surveillance choices. However, they
would be constrained by resources. Smaller organisations were unwilling to invest in surveillance for a pest that is not
yet present without additional support. Larger organisations would like to see a more detailed cost-effectiveness
comparison of different surveillance methods beyond our brief overview. Broadly, participants look to the authorities
for guidance, but would also expect to learn from European managers as EAB spreads through Europe. Participants in Kent
in particular mentioned that they might be unlikely to do more than they have already done to mitigate for and manage
ADB, especially as there are so few ash trees left in their holdings.

Looking ahead, participants would encourage natural predators such as woodpeckers and be interested in learning about
other biological control options. They would plant alternatives to ash, particularly that provide similar ecological
function. The protective capability of diverse woodlands was highlighted.

Overall, participants were interested in the new information and hearing about other land managers’ experiences and
perspectives.
