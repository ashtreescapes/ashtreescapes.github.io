## Aim

Elucidate the key epidemiological and behavioural factors that govern the invasion and spread of multiple threats to tree health and so determine how to develop successful surveillance and management at a whole system level, rather than on a pest by pest basis.

## Objectives

1. Develop a spatially explicit model of the spread of ADB and EAB at UK scale suitable to assess large-scale surveillance and predict the effect of control measures. The model will represent the host and potential points of entry for EAB
2. Carry out extensive social research on multi-stakeholder values, actions and acceptability of EAB management options in order to develop an agent-based model of stakeholder behaviours (social dynamics model).  
3. Link the epidemiological model to the social dynamics model and use this to elucidate the factors that make robust surveillance networks and effective strategies for the management of ash trees.
4. Delivery of research results.
